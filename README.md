# GuiglParty
A party full of guigly goodness!
Party with all of your favorite guigl characters!
Meet some new guigly faces! Walusneaky and Blooch are here to party!

To build Guiglparty, open the project with the most recent version of the Unity3D editor and build for the desired platform. Note that you will need to have access to a Midi keyboard in order to play. More standard input methods are coming soon.
